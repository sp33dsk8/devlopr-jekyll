This bulk malware sorter takes in millions of samples of malware and stores information about each sample in a mySQL database.  In addition the database is displayed using a django front end as a user friendly table with hyperlinks as seen above.

Working on the [Trojan Triage](https://github.com/chris-ault/TrojanTriage) program I developed:
* Front end using [Python Django framework](https://www.djangoproject.com/)
* [Back end automation of virtual machines for identifying malware](https://github.com/chris-ault/TrojanTriage/tree/master/VMautomation)
* [mySQL database for storing results](https://github.com/chris-ault/TrojanTriage/blob/master/Analysis/dllAnalysis_2DB/dllAnaly.py)
* [Automated malware sample analysis](https://github.com/chris-ault/TrojanTriage/tree/master/Analysis/fileAnalysis) using a Portable Executable parser [pefile](https://github.com/erocarrera/pefile) to identify DLL files used by the malware sample, hash, malware file entry point and signature
